## Act 1: The "Shepherd" Experience (Mobile View)
*Switch browser to Mobile Mode (iPhone 12/14 Pro)*

**Narrative**: "Imagine it's 9 AM. You haven't slept. Your father passed away last night. You're staring at your phone, overwhelmed by the 100 things you know you *should* do but have no idea what they are. You open Legacy."

1.  **The Hook**:
    *   Land on the **Guided Path**.
    *   *Point out*: It’s not a dashboard of charts. It’s a single, calm card. "Current Phase: Immediate."
    *   *Read*: "Focus only on immediate safety... Everything else can wait." (Radical reassurance).

2.  **The Step-by-Step**:
    *   **Step 1**: "Get a Legal Pronouncement of Death".
        *   Show the "Why this matters" section. (Education without overwhelming).
        *   Show the "Status": Completed (Pre-filled for demo).
    *   **Step 2**: "Arrange Transportation".
        *   *Narrative*: "You don't know who to call. Legacy tells you exactly what to say."
        *   Open the "How To" section. Read the script: "Tell them: A death has occurred..."
        *   **Action**: Click "Mark as Done".
        *   *Observe*: The progress bar fills. The card slides away. The next step appears instantly.
    *   **Step 3**: "Secure the Property".
        *   *Narrative*: "Something you might forget in grief—checking the thermostat, locking the windows."

## Act 2: The Comprehensive Safety Net (Desktop/Tablet View)
*Switch browser to Desktop Mode*

**Narrative**: "Fast forward two weeks. The funeral is over. Now the 'business' of death begins. The paperwork."

1.  **The "Topics" View**:
    *   Click **Topics** in the sidebar.
    *   Show the grid: Legal, Finance, Digital Identity.
    *   *Point out*: This handles the complex, non-linear stuff. "I need to stop his mail." -> Click "Government & Identity".

2.  **The Master List**:
    *   Click **All Tasks**.
    *   Scroll through phases.
    *   *Highlight*: "Phase 3: Early Admin".
    *   *Show*: "Notify Social Security" and "Secure Digital Identity".
    *   *Narrative*: "Legacy remembers these things so you don't have to."

## Act 3: The "Apple" Polish
*Highlight visual details throughout*

1.  **Design Language**:
    *   Notice the lack of harsh reds. The "calm" blue accents.
    *   The "Glassmorphism" on the sidebar (if supported).
    *   The "San Francisco" font stack—feels native to their iPhone.

2.  **PWA Capabilities**:
    *   Show how it works offline (simulated). "Grief doesn't always happen where there's Wi-Fi."

## Closing
"Legacy isn't just a checklist app. It's a process engine wrapped in empathy. It tells you what to do, why to do it, and most importantly—gives you permission to ignore the rest until you're ready."
