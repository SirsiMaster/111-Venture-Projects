# Changelog

## [3.3.0] - 2025-11-26

### Domain-Specific Multi-Agent Architecture

#### Agent System Implementation
Created 6 specialized domain agents with pre-flight checklists and dependency management:

| Agent | Path | Domain |
|-------|------|--------|
| Auth | `agents/auth/AGENT.md` | Authentication, users, sessions, MFA |
| Estate | `agents/estate/AGENT.md` | Estates, assets, heirs, 4-phase protocol |
| Vault | `agents/vault/AGENT.md` | Documents, OCR, encryption, versioning |
| Compliance | `agents/compliance/AGENT.md` | 6-state probate rules (IL, MI, MN, DC, VA, MD) |
| Notify | `agents/notify/AGENT.md` | Email, push, SMS, letter generation |
| LLM | `agents/llm/AGENT.md` | Vertex AI, RAG, recommendations |

#### Agent Governance Protocol
Every agent now includes:
- Pre-flight checklist (MUST complete before coding)
- Cross-agent impact analysis
- Dependency verification
- State verification commands
- Changelog tracking

#### Updated Documents
- `WARP.md` - Added agentic development model and agent invocation instructions
- `proposals/COST_PROPOSAL.md` - Added state-of-the-art agentic architecture section (3.1-3.5)

#### Architecture Philosophy
- Modular context (each agent fits context window)
- State awareness (pre-flight verifies system state)
- Coordinated changes (dependency graph prevents conflicts)
- Domain expertise (specialized knowledge per agent)
