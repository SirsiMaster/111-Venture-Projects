# Cost Proposal & Financial Narrative

**Project:** MyShepherd / FinalWishes Platform  
**Date:** December 11, 2025  
**Version:** 5.0.0 (The Strategic Advantage)

---

## 1. Executive Summary: The AI Arbitrage
The traditional software development model is broken. It relies on billing you for hours spent learning, debugging, and managing junior talent. At **111 Venture Studio**, we invert this model.

We leverage a "Centaur" approach: Top-tier human Architects guiding autonomous AI Agents (Gemini 3.0, Claude 3.5). This allows us to deliver a **$450,000+ enterprise-grade platform** for a fixed price of **$95,000** in just **20 weeks**.

**Your Investment:** $95,000 (Fixed Price)  
**Your Return:** A fully owned, SOC 2-ready, multi-state estate operating system with zero technical debt and "Big Tech" architecture.

## 2. Where the Money Goes (Transparency Model)
We do not hide our costs. We believe in radical transparency. Here is exactly how your capital is deployed to generate value.

### 2.1 The "Human-in-the-Loop" (High-Leverage Labor)
You are paying for **Strategy and Architectural perfection**, not potential keystrokes.

| Role | Focus | Rate (Blended) | Est. Hours | Allocation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lead Architect** | System design, Security, Critical Review | $200/hr | 120 | $24,000 |
| **Product Manager** | Scope, Legal Requirements, Acceptance | $150/hr | 80 | $12,000 |
| **Prompt Engineer** | Orchestrating AI Agents, Context Management | $100/hr | 200 | $20,000 |
| **Legal/QA Review** | Verifying Probate Logic & Forms | $150/hr | 40 | $6,000 |
| | | | **Subtotal:** | **$62,000** |

### 2.2 Hard Costs (The "War Chest")
We aggressively pre-pay for the tools and audits that guarantee success. These are included in your fixed price.

| Item | Description | Strategic Value | Allocation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Security Audit** | 3rd Party Pen Test (Week 18) | **SOC 2 Evidence.** We prove security before you launch. | $12,000 |
| **AI Inference** | Gemini/Claude Token Costs | **Unlimited Labor.** We generate millions of LOC without billing you. | $5,000 |
| **Legal Consult** | Probate Counsel in MD, IL, MN | **Accuracy.** Ensuring our "Shepherd" logic matches court realities. | $8,000 |
| **Infrastructure** | GCP & Dev Tools (5 Months) | **Velocity.** Enterprise tooling (GitHub, Sentry, Cursor) from Day 1. | $5,000 |
| | | **Subtotal:** | **$30,000** |

### 2.3 The "No-Surprise" Guarantee
We allocate a small margin for the unknown. If we don't use it, it goes into extra polish.
*   **Contingency Reserve:** $3,000 (3% of budget)

**GRAND TOTAL:** **$95,000**

## 3. Comparative Value Analysis
Why 111 Venture Studio is the only rational choice for this venture.

| Feature | 🏛️ Traditional Agency | 🤖 111 Venture Studio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Staffing** | 7-10 FTEs (mix of Junior/Senior) | 2 Experts + 5 Autonomous Agents |
| **Timeline** | 9-12 Months | **5 Months (Guaranteed)** |

## 4. Run Rate Analysis (Post-Launch)
We architect for **Serverless Efficiency**. We do not want you burning cash on empty servers.

**The "Sleep Mode" Architecture:**
Your platform runs on Google Cloud Run. If no one is using it at 3 AM, your server cost drops to **nearly zero**. You only pay for active processing.

**Monthly Operating Costs (Per 1,000 Active Users):**

| Component | Provider | Cost Driver | Monthly Est. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compute** | Cloud Run | Scale-to-Zero | $50.00 |
| **Database** | Cloud SQL | Shared Postgres | $20.00 |
| **Storage** | Cloud Storage | Document Vault | $10.00 |
| **AI Guidance** | Vertex AI | RAG/Chat Queries | $200.00 |
| **Banking Data** | Plaid | Account Linking | $300.00 |
| **TOTAL OPEX** | | | **~$580 / month** |

*Compare this to the revenue of 1,000 subscribers @ $199/yr = $16,583/mo.*
**Margin:** **96%+ is achievable.**

## 5. Payment Schedule
We tie payments to **tangible value**, not dates on a calendar.
