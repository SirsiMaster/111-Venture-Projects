# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GOVERNANCE RULES (MUST FOLLOW)

### **RULE 0: CHALLENGE BAD IDEAS**
If my approach is flawed, tell me immediately. Product quality > accommodation.

---

### **RULE 1: CHECK SIRSI FIRST, THEN LEGACY**
Before building anything, check if it exists in Sirsi's universal library (`/Users/thekryptodragon/Development/sirsimaster-component-library`) or Assiduous codebase (`/Users/thekryptodragon/Development/assiduous`). Everything we build flows back to Sirsi eventually - that's the virtuous cycle.

---

### **RULE 2: IMPLEMENT, DON'T INSTRUCT**
Build working code end-to-end. No "here's how to set it up" responses.

---

### **RULE 3: TEST IN BROWSER BEFORE CLAIMING COMPLETE**
Open DevTools, click through workflows, verify zero errors. If I haven't tested it in production, it's not done.

---

### **RULE 4: FOLLOW THE PIPELINE**
LOCAL → GITHUB → FIREBASE. Never skip GitHub. Always test in production immediately.

---

### **RULE 5: MATCH EXISTING DESIGN**
Copy CSS from existing pages. If design doesn't match, it's incomplete.

---

### **RULE 6: MEASURE BY SPECS, NOT FILE COUNTS**
Completion comes from USER_STORIES.md and REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md, not arbitrary metrics.

---

### **RULE 7: ENHANCE, DON'T DUPLICATE**
Improve existing pages rather than creating new ones. Link to `/docs/`, don't copy.

---

## THE META-RULE

**If any rule conflicts with delivering a world-class product, challenge the rule and propose a better approach.**

These rules exist to ensure quality and efficiency, not to create bureaucracy. If a rule is getting in the way of excellence, speak up and explain why a different approach would be better.

The goal is a world-class product. Everything else is negotiable.

## Agentic Development Model

### Agent Architecture
Development is organized into **domain-specific agents**, each responsible for a discrete area of the codebase. When working on a feature, load the relevant agent's context file first.

| Agent | Domain | Context File |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Auth** | Authentication, users, sessions | `agents/auth/AGENT.md` |
| **Estate** | Estates, assets, beneficiaries, phases | `agents/estate/AGENT.md` |
| **Vault** | Document storage, OCR, encryption | `agents/vault/AGENT.md` |
| **Compliance** | 6-state probate rules, templates | `agents/compliance/AGENT.md` |
| **Notify** | Emails, push, SMS, letters | `agents/notify/AGENT.md` |
| **LLM** | Vertex AI, guidance, recommendations | `agents/llm/AGENT.md` |

### Working with Agents
1. **Before starting work:** Read the relevant `AGENT.md` file(s)
2. **Stay in domain:** Each agent owns specific Firestore collections, Functions, and UI components
3. **Update status:** Mark checkboxes in AGENT.md as features complete
4. **Cross-agent work:** When touching multiple domains, load all relevant agent contexts
5. **Add to changelog:** Update the agent's changelog when making changes

### Agent Dependencies
```
                    ┌─────────┐
                    │  Auth   │ (root - no dependencies)
                    └────┬────┘
                         │
          ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
          ▼              ▼              ▼
    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
    │ Estate  │◄───│  Vault  │    │ Compliance  │
    └────┬────┘    └────┬────┘    └──────┬──────┘
         │              │                │
         └──────────────┼────────────────┘
                        ▼
                  ┌─────────┐
                  │ Notify  │
                  └────┬────┘
                       ▼
                  ┌─────────┐
                  │   LLM   │ (depends on all)
                  └─────────┘
```

### Invoking an Agent
To work on a specific domain, say:
- "Work on Auth" → Load `agents/auth/AGENT.md`
- "Work on Estate" → Load `agents/estate/AGENT.md`
- "Work on Compliance for Illinois" → Load `agents/compliance/AGENT.md`

## Project Overview
**Legacy** is "The Estate Operating System" - an end-of-life estate management platform with web and PWA applications. The project uses AI-agentic development (Claude + AI tools) with no human developer team.

**Platform Status:** Phase 1 - Foundation (Auth + Core DB)

**Development Model:** AI-Agentic (Claude as Stack Leader)

## Technology Stack (GCP/Firebase)
- **Backend:** Firebase Functions (Cloud Functions)
- **Database:** Firestore (NoSQL with real-time sync)
- **Auth:** Firebase Authentication (with MFA)
- **Storage:** Cloud Storage for Firebase (encrypted documents)
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting
- **AI/LLM:** Vertex AI / Claude API for intelligent process guidance
- **Integrations:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tool automation
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions → Firebase

## Design Aesthetic: "Opulent, Permanent, Guardian-Like"
- Deep Royal Blue Gradient background (NOT black)
- Solid Metallic Gold (`#D4AF37`) buttons with hover brightening (NO gradients on buttons)
- High-contrast text (`text-gray-100` or white)
- Compact footer (`py-8`)
- "Alive UI" with green pulse dots on cards
- Tech borders/glowing frames
- `bg-grain` film overlay for texture

**DO NOT:**
- Make technology changes without updating ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md
- Contradict established patterns in TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md

### Interaction Rules
- Always provide a link to the live page after completing a task
- Format code blocks with file path and start line
