# Requirements Specification
## Legacy - The Estate Operating System
**Version:** 1.1.0

**Status:** Draft - Pending Approval

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for the Legacy platform—an AI-powered estate management system designed to automate end-of-life administration across web, iOS, and Android platforms.

### 1.2 Scope
Legacy transforms the chaotic 18-month estate settlement process into a streamlined 4-phase protocol: **Intake → Verify → Notify → Distribute**. The system serves three primary user types: Principals (account holders planning their estate), Executors (managing an estate post-death), and Heirs (receiving assets).

### 1.3 Geographic Scope (MVP)
Initial launch supports **6 states** with state-specific probate rules and institution templates:

| Region | States | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Midwest** | Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota | Different probate thresholds |
| **Mid-Atlantic** | District of Columbia, Virginia, Maryland | Common metro area (DC/MD/VA) |

*Additional states targeted for v1.1+*

### 1.4 Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Principal | The individual whose estate is being managed (account owner) |
| Executor | Person(s) authorized to administer the estate after Principal's death |
| Heir | Beneficiary designated to receive assets |
| Estate | The totality of assets, documents, and digital footprint of the Principal |
| Shepherd | Legacy's AI-powered workflow automation engine |
| Protocol | The 4-phase estate settlement process |
