        shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="services-and-engagement">3. SERVICES AND ENGAGEMENT</h2>
  <p><strong>3.1 Statements of Work.</strong> Provider shall provide the
    Services and Deliverables to Client as specified in each SOW. Each SOW
    shall be effectively incorporated into this Agreement. In the event of a
    conflict between the terms of this Agreement and an SOW, the terms of
    the SOW shall control ONLY regarding the specific description of
    Services, fees, and timeline; for all other legal terms and conditions,
    this Agreement shall control.</p>
  <p><strong>3.2 Standard of Performance.</strong> Provider represents and
    warrants that the Services will be performed in a professional,
    workmanlike manner, by qualified personnel, and consistent with the
    highest industry standards for similar enterprise-grade software
    development services. Provider shall devote adequate resources to meet
    its obligations under this Agreement.</p>
  <p><strong>3.3 Change Orders.</strong> Client may, at any time, request
    changes to the scope of the Services (“Change Request”). If Provider
    determines that such changes will impact the fees, timeline, or
    technical architecture, Provider shall submit a written “Change Order”
    detailing the impact. No change shall be effective until the Change
    Order is signed by both Parties. Minor changes requiring less than eight
    (8) hours of effort may be approved via written correspondence (email
    sufficient).</p>
  <p><strong>3.4 Non-Exclusivity.</strong> Client acknowledges that
    Provider is a professional services firm and may provide similar
    services to third parties, provided that Provider does not use Client’s
    Confidential Information or specifically commissioned Deliverables for
    such third parties.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="compensation-and-payment">4. COMPENSATION AND PAYMENT</h2>
  <p><strong>4.1 Fees.</strong> Client shall pay Provider the fees set
    forth in the applicable SOW. Unless otherwise specified in an SOW, fees
    for fixed-price projects shall be payable according to the agreed-upon
    milestone schedule.</p>
  <p><strong>4.2 Expenses.</strong> Client shall reimburse Provider for
    reasonable, documented “Pass-Through Expenses” incurred in connection
    with the Services (e.g., specific cloud infrastructure costs,
    third-party API licensing fees, software licenses specifically required
    for the Project). Provider shall obtain Client’s prior written approval
    for any individual expense exceeding Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00).
    Travel expenses shall only be reimbursable if pre-approved by Client in
    writing.</p>
  <p><strong>4.3 Payment Terms.</strong> Provider shall submit invoices to
    Client upon completion of Milestones or monthly for Time &amp; Materials
    engagements. Invoices are due and payable <strong>Net Fifteen
      (15)</strong> days from the invoice date.</p>
  <p><strong>4.4 Late Payments.</strong> Undisputed payments not received
    by the due date shall accrue interest at the lesser of one and one-half
    percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by law.</p>
  <p><strong>4.5 Taxes.</strong> Fees do not include any sales, use,
    value-added, or similar taxes. Client shall be responsible for paying
    all such taxes properly levied on the Services, excluding taxes based on
    Provider’s net income, property, or employees.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="intellectual-property-rights">5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
    RIGHTS</h2>
  <p><strong>5.1 Work Made for Hire.</strong> Provider agrees that all
    Deliverables created for Client under this Agreement shall be considered
    “works made for hire” to the extent permitted by law. To the extent that
    any Deliverable does not qualify as a work made for hire under
    applicable law, Provider hereby irrevocably assigns to Client all right,
    title, and interest in and to such Deliverable, including all
    Intellectual Property Rights therein, free and clear of all liens and
    encumbrances.</p>
  <p><strong>5.2 Background Technology.</strong> Notwithstanding Section
    5.1, Provider retains all right, title, and interest in and to its
    Background Technology. Provider hereby grants to Client a perpetual,
    irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide,
    sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, display, distribute,
    and create derivative works of any Background Technology incorporated
    into the Deliverables, solely as necessary for Client to utilize,
    exploit, and maintain the Deliverables for their intended purpose.</p>
  <p><strong>5.3 Third-Party and Open Source Software.</strong> The
    Deliverables may contain third-party software or open source software.
    Provider warrants that its use of such software will comply with the
    applicable licenses (e.g., AGPL-3.0, MIT, Apache 2.0). Provider shall
    identify any “Copyleft” libraries (that would mandate disclosure of
    Client’s source code) prior to integration and obtain Client’s
    approval.</p>
  <p><strong>5.4 AI-Generated Content.</strong> The Parties acknowledge
    that Provider utilizes advanced Artificial Intelligence tools (e.g.,
    Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude) to assist in code generation and
    architecture. Provider warrants that it has the full legal right to
    assign ownership of such AI-generated output to Client as part of the
    Deliverables, and that such use does not violate the terms of service of
    the AI providers.</p>
  <p><strong>5.5 Further Assurances.</strong> Provider agrees to execute
    any documents and take any actions reasonably requested by Client to
    perfect Client’s ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights in the
    Deliverables.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="confidentiality">6. CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>
  <p><strong>6.1 Obligations.</strong> The Receiving Party agrees: (i) to
    hold the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in strict
    confidence and take reasonable precautions to protect it (including all
    precautions the Receiving Party employs with respect to its own
    confidential materials); (ii) not to divulge any such Confidential
    Information to any third party (other than employees, contractors, or
    agents who have a need to know and are bound by written confidentiality
    obligations); and (iii) not to use such Confidential Information except
    for the performance of this Agreement.</p>
  <p><strong>6.2 Exclusions.</strong> Confidential Information shall not
    include information that: (a) is or becomes generally available to the
    public without breach of this Agreement; (b) was in the Receiving
    Party’s possession prior to disclosure without legal restriction; (c) is
    captured by the Receiving Party from a third party who had the legal
    right to disclose it; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving
    Party without reference to or use of the Confidential Information.</p>
  <p><strong>6.3 Data Security &amp; SOC 2 Compliance.</strong> Provider
    acknowledges that it may have access to Client’s data, which may include
    Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Provider agrees to implement
    and maintain commercially reasonable technical and organizational
    security measures—consistent with SOC 2 Type II criteria—to protect such
    data from unauthorized access, use, modification, or disclosure. This
    includes, but is not limited to, encryption of data at rest and in
    transit, access controls, and regular security audits.</p>
  <p><strong>6.4 Compelled Disclosure.</strong> If the Receiving Party is
    required by law or court order to disclose Confidential Information, it
    shall give the Disclosing Party prompt written notice (if legally
    permitted) to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order.</p>

  <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> FinalWishes Platform Development<br />
    <strong>SOW Reference:</strong> SOW-2024-001 | Associated MSA:

  <h2 id="executive-overview">1. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW</h2>
  <h3 id="primary-objective">Primary Objective</h3>
  <p>Deliver a dual-purpose platform that empowers the Living to
    <strong>Curate their Legacy</strong> (Memories &amp; Wishes) and equips
    their Loved Ones to <strong>Automate the Estate</strong> (Probate &amp;
    Assets).
  </p>
  <p>This Statement of Work (“SOW”) defines the comprehensive scope for
    the <strong>FinalWishes Estate Operating System</strong>. While
    competent estate management is critical, <strong>FinalWishes is not
      merely a probate tool.</strong> It is a Legacy Management Application
    designed to capture the “Soul” of the Principal—their memories, values,
    and final messages—before dealing with the “Administration” of their
    assets.</p>
  <p>We serve the <strong>Human</strong> first and the
    <strong>Process</strong> second. By curating the emotional legacy of the
    soon-to-be-deceased, we effectively arm the Executor not just with legal
    documents, but with the moral authority and clear instructions needed to
    protect the family from conflict.
