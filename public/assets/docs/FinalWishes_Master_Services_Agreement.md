Minor changes requiring less than eight (8) hours of effort may be approved via written correspondence (email sufficient).

**5.4 AI-Generated Content.** The Parties acknowledge that Provider utilizes advanced Artificial Intelligence tools (e.g., Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude) to assist in code generation and architecture. Provider warrants that it has the full legal right to assign ownership of such AI-generated output to Client as part of the Deliverables, and that such use does not violate the terms of service of the AI providers.

# EXHIBIT A: STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

**Project Name:** FinalWishes Platform Development  
**SOW Reference:** SOW-2024-001 | Associated MSA: MSA-2024-111-FW  
**Date:** December 19, 2024

## 1. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

### Primary Objective

Deliver a dual-purpose platform that empowers the Living to **Curate their Legacy** (Memories & Wishes) and equips their Loved Ones to **Automate the Estate** (Probate & Assets).

This Statement of Work ("SOW") defines the comprehensive scope for the **FinalWishes Estate Operating System**. While competent estate management is critical, **FinalWishes is not merely a probate tool.** It is a Legacy Management Application designed to capture the "Soul" of the Principal—their memories, values, and final messages—before dealing with the "Administration" of their assets.

We serve the **Human** first and the **Process** second. By curating the emotional legacy of the soon-to-be-deceased, we effectively arm the Executor not just with legal documents, but with the moral authority and clear instructions needed to protect the family from conflict.

# EXHIBIT B: COST PROPOSAL & ROI ANALYSIS

## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal offers a transparent, atomic breakdown of the investment required to build the "Vault-Grade" estate settlement platform. Unlike opaque agency pricing or "billable hour" law firm models, we provide a fixed-price engineering partnership.

## 2. Comparative Market Analysis

| Metric | "Big Law" Custom Tech | Typical Dev Agency | Sirsi (111 VS) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Total Cost | $650,000+ | $350,000+ | **$200,000 (Standard)** |
